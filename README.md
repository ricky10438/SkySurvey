# Sky Survey Classification - ML Olympiad (NYTFUG)

## Objective
Classify celestial objects (stars, galaxies, and quasars) based on their spectral characteristics using the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) dataset.

## Approach

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **skySurveyInitial**: Compared training and test datasets to identify distribution differences.
- **EDA_X_TRAIN**: Explored the training data through correlation analysis, pivot tables, and feature distributions.

### Feature Engineering
- Created new features to highlight spectral differences.

### Modelling
- Built predictive models using **XGBoost** for classification.
- Experimented with alternative models for performance comparison.
- Conducted hyperparameter tuning to optimise model accuracy.

## Files
- **skySurveyInitial.ipynb**: Initial EDA comparing training and test datasets.
- **EDA_X_TRAIN.ipynb**: In-depth exploration of training data.
- **ModellingSkySurvey.ipynb**: Model development and evaluation.
